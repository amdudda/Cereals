  DESCRIPTION
  This file lists price info for ingredients in the format of:
  ingredient_name [space] maxqty [space] price

  maxqty is the cutoff for the listed price, so
  "corn 80 .50" means "the price of less than 80 kg of corn is $0.50 per kg"

  Thus,
  rice 100 .50
  rice 500 .43
  rice 0 .30

  means:
  "if the weight of the order of rice is less than 100kg, the price is 50 cents per kg.
  if the weight of the order of rice is 100kg or more, but less than 500 kg, the price is 43 cents per kg.
  if the order weighs 500 kg or more, the price is 30 cents per kg"

  notice that this is a... *ahem*... "special" use of zero to mean "default value".
